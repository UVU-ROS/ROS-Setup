# Setup Files
This repository contains all the necessary configuration files for running ROS on your XIOAR robot. All these files should already be installed on the robot, but should something go wrong hopefully this repo saves someone some heartache.
It is our hope that reading the wiki will help you avoid many of the pitfalls we encountered this semester and move forward to new territory.
